  Q: What is the Cantonese Script Reform Project?
  A: The Cantonese Script Reform Project (Jyutcitzi) is an initiative to develop a standardized written system for the Cantonese language that enhances its accessibility and preserves its unique linguistic features. The project aims to create a script that runs parallel with Chinese characters while maintaining aesthetic congruence.
  Q: Why do we need a script reform for Cantonese?
  A: While Cantonese speakers have traditionally used Chinese characters, there is a need for a standardized writing system that better represents the spoken language. A script reform would enable the creation of written works that are more true to the Cantonese language, bridging the gap between written and spoken forms.
  Q: What is Jyutcitzi?
  A: Jyutcitzi (JCZ: , Honzi: 粵切字) is a new script for Cantonese. Jyutcitzi is the core proposal of the Cantonese Script Reform Movement, which advocates for the adoption of Jyutcitzi to complement Chinese characters to complete the development of Cantonese writing.
  Jyutcitzi, unlike Chinese characters, is a phonetic script. To write a Cantonese word in Jyutcitzi, you use the principle of faan-cit (JCZ: , Honzi: 反切 ) to divide up the word into a initial onset and a final onset. These onsets are then mapped into their respective Jyutcitzi letters, which is Chinese character with the same initial or final. The two letters are then combined to produce a third character. Diacritics may be added to represent the tone. So for example, for the word "Jyut6" (粵, classical name for the Cantonese region), the factorisation would be:
- J → 央
- yut → 乙
- tone 6 → ゛
  The initial determines the composition rule, and in the case of 央, it is a ⿱ top-bottom structure, the final product is󱛍.

Q: How does the project plan to achieve its goals?
A: The project takes inspiration from other languages, such as Korean and Japanese, which have successfully developed their own writing systems while retaining cultural connections to Chinese characters. Jyutcitzi (粵切字 ) is a phonetic script that can coexist with Chinese characters, allowing for a seamless transition between the two.
Q: What can I do to support the Cantonese Script Reform Project?
A: You can join this Reddit community to participate in discussions, provide feedback, and stay informed about the latest developments. You can also share resources, essays, and other materials related to the project to help spread awareness and generate interest.
We look forward to working together towards a brighter future for the Cantonese language! 🌞
